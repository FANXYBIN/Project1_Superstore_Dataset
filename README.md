# Project1_Superstore_Dataset
In this project, I selected a superstore dataset from Kaggle and aimed to derive insights about the performance of the superstore using the R statistical tool. It also includes several dimensions like Categories, Sub-Category, Product Name, Order Date, Shipping Mode, Market, Segment, etc.
